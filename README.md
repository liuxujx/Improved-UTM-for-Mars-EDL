# Improved-UTM-for-Mars-EDL
This repository is an improvement and supplement of Kshitij Mall's UTM1.0-Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Problem: https://github.com/kshitijmall/UTM1.0
In Mall's repository, it seems that some files of the Mars EDL case are missing.
Therefore, I wrote this programm to debug the Mars EDL case and improved the two solution options of the UTM into one solution.
This repository is a component of a paper that is currently being reviewed.
